<!-- START DESCRIPTION lightstreamer-jms-example-stocklist-client-android -->

## Details

This is a Java-for-Android version of the [Lightstreamer - Basic Stock-List Demo - HTML client](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-example-StockList-client-javascript#basic-stock-list-demo---html-client).<br>
This app uses the <b>Android Client API for Lightstreamer</b> to handle the communications with Lightstreamer Server. A simple user interface is implemented to display the real-time data received from Lightstreamer Server.<br>

This demo displays real-time market data for 20 stocks, generated by the feed simulator included in the [Lightstreamer JMS Extender - Stock-List Demo - Java (JMS) Service](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-JMS-example-StockList-service-java). For simplicity, only the `stock_name` and `last_price` fields of updated items are displayed, and they are just logged to the console. Moreover, a single JMS topic is used for all stocks, while in a real scenario you would probably use a different JMS topic for each stock.

Check out the sources for further explanations.
  
## Build

If you want to install a version of this demo pointing to your local Lightstreamer JMS Extender and running into 
an [Android Virtual Device](http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html), follow these steps:

* Note that, as prerequisite, the [Lightstreamer JMS Extender - Stock-List Demo - Java (JMS) Service](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-JMS-example-StockList-service-java) has to be deployed on your local Lightstreamer JMS Extender instance. Please check out that project and follow the installation instructions provided with it.

* Launch Lightstreamer JMS Extender.

* Locate or install the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* Install the `Android_StockListDemo.apk` in your emulator:
  * Execute the emulator (Android SDK/SDK Manager->Tools->Manage AVDs...->New then Start)
  * Open the console and move to the platform-tools folder of SDK directory.
  * Then type the following command:
    ```
    adb install [.apk path]
    ```
* Look up the demo in your virtual device and launch it.

*Note that the demo targets the Lightstreamer server @ http://10.0.2.2:8080 because 10.0.2.2 is the special alias to your host loopback interface.*
